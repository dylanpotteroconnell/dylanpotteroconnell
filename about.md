The quickest way to learn something new is to read what other's have done, and I lean heavily on the helpful work that others post online It only seems seems fair that I provide some short writeups of my own on some of the new projects I experiment with Nothing here should be considered a definitive reference, because this is specifically based on topics I don't understand (and I am confident that each of these projects could be done far better by an expert). That being said, it can still be helpful for a novice working on something similar, because anything explained here is at an introductory level.
