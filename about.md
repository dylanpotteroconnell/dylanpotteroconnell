The quickest way to learn something new is to read what other's have done. When I learn something new, I lean heavily on the helpful work that others post online. Thus, it seems like in return some of the projects I play around with I should provide a brief writeup, in case someone happens to be working on anything similar and benefits from seeing me stumble through it. Nothing here should be considered a definitive reference, because this is specifically based on topics I don't understand (and I am confident that each of these projects could be done far better by an expert). That being said, it can still be helpful for a novice working on something similar, because anything explained here is at an introductory level.
