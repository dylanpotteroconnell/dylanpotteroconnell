title: OddsConverter Extension\: Uploading to Chrome Webstore
——

Brief update to the [past post](https://dylanpotteroconnell.github.io/bettingextension2/). I knew a few people who wanted to try the extension, so I thought it’d be a fun exercise to go through the process of uploading it to the Chrome store. You can view and add the extension to your own browser [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/odds-converter/klechkhopfnjihobbcfeheooaigjjgdg). This is far from a polished state, given that it was meant to be a quick way to explore something new. However, I do find myself using the finished product a surprising amount, so I thought it was worth keeping on the Webstore. And it’s nice to see how easy Google makes it to upload a simple app.
