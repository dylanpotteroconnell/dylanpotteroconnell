title: Elo Ratings&#58; Predictive Efficacy of Prior World Cup Results 
---

The FIFA World Cup is the biggest biggest spectacle of the sports, and even entertainment, world. With tens of billions of dollars bet on its results, it presents a fascinating predictive challenge. Its structure defies that of regular domestic sports leagues, which offer regular and consistent competitive results which we can use to gauge future performance. National teams play each other infrequently, and there are frequently large shifts in roster between each meaningful competition. True World Cup predictions have to go far beyond standard sabermetric models, and have to consider a wide array of input information.

This provides an intereting opportunity to consider the practical limits of an analytical model in such a challenging situation. We consider the efficacy of predicting national team strength using solely the World Cup results of the past 20 years. The core of this short project was originally written in five days as part of a curricular project (knowing little about international football), hence some of the initial restrictions, but it has been expanded since. The original paper goes into some detail [here]({{ site.url }}/images/doconnell_practicalexamreport.pdf), but I'll highlight some points in this post.

### Challenges

We start with a brief overview of why common statistical approaches are poorly suited to this problem. This will be fairly obvious to most, but these challenges inform any more successful approach, and need to be kept in mind. A naive approach to predict the outcome of a match might be to consider the past results between the two teams in question. However, the sparsity of the dataset makes this impossible. Of the 48 matches played in the 2018 group stage, only 14 of them involve a pair of teams which have a single game played in our dataset. This is not solely due to the vast number of national teams and the infrequency of scheduled matches, but becuase the qualifying and group selection process specifically encourages matchup diversity. Qualfication is done by region, so a large number of a team's total games will be against the same consistent competition, while group selection encourages a variety of regional representation.

The closed nature of regional qualification highlights the primary challenge in this task. Almost any measurable result in football matters only relative to its competition. As an example
