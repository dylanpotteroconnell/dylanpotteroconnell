title: World Cup Elo Part 2&#58; Tuning the Model

*Part 1 can be found [here](https://dylanpotteroconnell.github.io/worldcup/), and a followup discussing the eventual observed World Cup results is found [here](https://dylanpotteroconnell.github.io/bettinggroupstageresults/).*

### Elo Rating System Choices

As previously described, the Elo rating system is a broad and flexible framework, rather than a monolithic model. In fact, the primary draw of this project was to better understand the subjective choices that any person constructing such a model must make, and how we can use our intuition and domain knowledge to make plausible choices. In this post, I'll briefly outline how one might approach some of those choices in the context of the World Cup.

#### Calibrating Draws

The Elo rating system only computes an Expected Score for a given matchup, which does not uniquely determine the likelihood of a draw. We consider draws worth half a point (so Expected Score $= P(\text{Win}) + P(\text{Draw})/2$), but an Expected Score of $1/2$ might correspond to a 50% chance of either team winning (and no chance of a draw), or 100% chance of a draw, or anything in between. Thus, we need to find a formula to convert from Expected Score to the chances of either team winning or a draw. There is no perfect system to do this, the best we can do is examine historical data, and find a plausble mapping.
 
The details are covered in Section 3.1 of the corresponding paper. In the [top four leagues](https://www.progressivebetting.co.uk/statistics/football_statistics/leagues_by_draws/), about 26% of matches end in a draw. In our full dataset, only 21.7% of matches end in a draw, but in the group stage, 25.1% end in a draw. This fits out intuition, as the qualifying stages have significantly less parity, which reduces the chance of a draw. As a final ballpark estimate, we consider the draw percentages of individual matches implicitly predicted by Premiere league [sportsbooks](https://pena.lt/y/2015/12/12/frequency-of-draws-in-football/), and note that the draw percentage almost never rises above 31%, with a heavy left tail. Thus, for our initial estimate, we choose that two evenly matched teams have about a 29% chance of a draw (about one standard deviation above what we see in top leagues). Then, when we run our Elo model, we can select values of a tuning parameter (which we call $k_d$), which increases the likelihood of a draw, as shown in \ref{eqn:draws}. Again, the messiness of these models lies in the fact that there is no truly rigorous approach. However, this fits our intuition, and can be adjusted until it best fits our variety of historical data.

\begin{equation} P(\text{Draw}) = .29(1-2|ES-1/2|)^{k_d}.\label{eqn:draws}
\end{equation}

### Incorporationg Margin of Victory (MOV)

So far, when we refer to the ``score" (or ``Expected Score" or ``Observed Score") in the context of our Elo ratings, we have been referring to the match result (with $1$ denoting a win, $1/2$ a tie, and $0$ a loss). This approach is sensible,  but it is possible that we are missing out on additional valuable information by ignoring the margin of victory (which is the difference between the scores of the two respective teams). We have to be careful not to overweight margin of victory, as it is match result that ultimately determines advancement (in qualifying and group stage matches, margin of victory is only ever a tiebreaker), so teams do not have as much incentive to widen a blowout lead as they do to gain the lead. Further, we have to be concerned with the concept of ``garbage time", which is a widely believed phenomena where teams will not necessarily play their hardest once flipping the game result is essentially out of reach (the idea is that if a team is down multiple goals without much time left, they may ``give up" and be more likely to concede additional goals, leading to a wider blowout). Thus, we wish to test margin of victory as an alternative approach to our regular score format. 

We still need to have the score range from $0$ to $1$, with $1/2$ denoting a draw. However, when using margin of victory, we can now treat narrow victories as not being worth a full point, and the same for narrow defeats being worth more than $0$ points. As mentioned before, we want to minimize the impact of ``garbage time" goals on our rating, thus we want to make sure that the difference between a 1 goal win and a draw is substantially more than the difference between a 5 goal win and a 4 goal win. As before, let $S_A$ be the observed score of the match, and let $M_A$ be team A's margin of victory (which is negative in a loss). Then, we choose our score function so that each additional goal brings the score half the remaining distance to $1$ (or $0$), as shown in Equation \ref{eqn:mov} (for $M_A=0$, we define this sum to be $0$, so $S_A=1/2$). Thus, a draw is worth $1/2$ score, winning by one goal is worth $3/4$ score, and losing by 2 goals is worth $1/8$ score, and so on. Thus, the most significant goal is still the difference between a win and a draw, and each successive goal adds more (but decreasing) weight to the significance of the result. It is not obvious that this approach is superior to that of our original simple score system, and we have to test this approach and see if it provides a better hit to the histrical data.

\begin{equation}
S_A =  1/2 + \text{Sign}\{M_A\}\sum_{i=1}^{|M_A|} 1/2(1/2)^i \label{eqn:mov}
\end{equation}
